# Getting Started

Install `mlx-server` via pip to get started. This installation will install `mlx` as well.

## Install using PyPI

```bash copy
pip install mlx-server
```

To install from PyPI you must meet the following requirements:

- Using an M series chip (Apple silicon)
- Using a native Python >= 3.8
- macOS >= 13.3

## Usage

The following is an example of using `Mistral 7B Instruct` for generating text:

```python copy
from mlx_server import MLXServer

server = MLXServer(model="mlx-community/mistral-7B-v0.1")

response = server.chat(messages=[
    {
        'role': 'user',
        'content': 'Write me a poem about the ocean.'
    }
])

print(response['message']['content'])
```

## Note

This library only runs on Apple Metal. The MLX library focuses on Apple Metal acceleration.
