# MLXServer

This is the entry point of an `mlx-server` application. It loads a model to memory and starts the server to start accepting HTTP requests.

## Usage

Note: make sure you have the memory requirements to run the model. We will add more logging for this in the future.

```python copy
from mlxserver import MLXServer

server = MLXServer(model="mlx-community/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO-4bit-MLX")
```

## Parameters

**model** (required) - The model to load and run the server to to call. Check out [mlx-community]() for models.

**port**- The port to run the server on. Default:`4431` (this is just some random port, lol)
