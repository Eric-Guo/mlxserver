# Contribution

We plan to make this library the easiest way to building ML applications natively on Mac. Please contribute to the GitHub Repo, any of the following are highly appreciated:

- Bug fixes are always welcome!
- Highlighting of issues.
- Improving test coverage (I know we need to get better at this)
- Features are welcome as well, just make sure you communicate properly before building.
